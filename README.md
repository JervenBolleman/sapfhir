# SapFhir

Join genomic variation graphs with public data or internal medical data e.g. FHIR.
by having a FAIR data access, using W3C sparql as a standard protocol.

# Status

This is a [RDF4j](https://rdf4j.org/) SAIL implementation that can take any handlegraph4j 
implementation and represent it as a [W3C sparql 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) endpoint. 

It is beleived to be functionally complete.
